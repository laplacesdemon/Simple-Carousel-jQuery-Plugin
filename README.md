Simple Carousel jQuery Plugin
=============================

Very simple image gallery / carousel. It just creates previous and next buttons on the image and allows you to navigate between your images.

This is my first jQuery plugin. Although I develop it due to a need on my project, still it is more like an educational project for me.

Usage
-----
$(document).ready(function() {
    // initialize the carousel like this
    $(".storyviewcontentsol").simpleCarousel();

    // optionally you can skip to next image
    $(".storyviewcontentsol").simpleCarousel("next");

    // see methods section for more information
})

Methods
------

* next
* prev
* destroy
* show_buttons
